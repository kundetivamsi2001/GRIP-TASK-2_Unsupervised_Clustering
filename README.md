# GRIP-TASK-2_Unsupervised_Clustering
TASK 2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML
Clustering is the technique in Unsupervised learning,which will group the similar datapoints into clusters.
Kmeans is the clustering technique we had used to divide the entire iris dataset into optimum number of clusters.

Clustering means making groups or making clusters of similar observations. It groups the data into K clusters.
 ***************How does K-Means clustering algorithm work?

1: K points randomly selected as cluster centers(centroids).

2: All the nearest points to these K centroids form a cluster.

3: Means of all points of various clusters is found. 

4: These mean points are the new cluster centers or centroids. 

5: Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the centroids stop moving or changing or stopping criteria is reached like maximum iterations etc. 

6: Final centroids are cluster centers and all the points nearest to a centroid belong to that cluster.

Thank you..
